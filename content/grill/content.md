Grill 2: Inaguration Grill

rating: 3/10

pros: found this one a day after inaguration on the mall right outside the capitol building. Honestly this one is only getting a score this high becuse of its historical significance. I mean come on what was it doin there??

cons: does not look good at all, its askew nature makes me uncomfortable, its extremly dirty, and I feel like the score here is also a reflection of the political state of America

Grill numer uno: Washington Quad grill

rating: 4/10

pros: great memories, great location

cons: always super dirty, the area for the charcoal is sooooo far from where the food gets cooked so it takes forever to heat up and uses a lot of fuel. To compound this the cooking grates are SUPER thick and also take forever to heat up. Get here at least an hour early to prepare for cooking
