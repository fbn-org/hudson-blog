Grill numer uno: Washington Quad grill

rating: 4/10

pros: great memories, great location

cons: always super dirty, the area for the charcoal is sooooo far from where the food gets cooked so it takes forever to heat up and uses a lot of fuel. To compound this the cooking grates are SUPER thick and also take forever to heat up. Get here at least an hour early to prepare for cooking
