# The Dinner of the Century

Tonight we (Colin Eric Matty me) went to a very fancy resturant on top of the Four Seasons in Philly. It was called Jean-Georges. We walked in and man I couldnt help but laugh it was that fancy. We ordered 1 of everything on the menu (except for one of the caviars) and it was delicious. The waiter went to UMD too so pretty cool
