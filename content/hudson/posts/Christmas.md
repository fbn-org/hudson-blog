# Christmas in DC

Merry Christmas everyone! I had a lovely Christmas with my family in DC this year. We had a bit of a non-traditional hors d'oeuvres based dinner (way too much effort for not enough food) (thanks for the brie recipie Jimmy). 

Christmas morning we spent opening secret santa gifts. I got my sister and gave her things to make candles. She loved it. I recieved a model Supermarine Spitfire which is pretty much exactly what I wanted. 

After gifts, Cooper and Samantha left to go spend the day with her family. We went on a long walk in the city to go see the White House, National Christmas Tree, Jefferson Memorial, and Lincon Memorial. The tree is always dissappointing but there was a guy there playing different countries' national athems and music.
