# Classy Christmas + Formal

I don't have much to say about this. We hosted a classy christmas party which I have wanted to do for a while and it was very fun. It turned not classy real quick. The next night was formal at Zebbies Garden. Also very fun. 2 night wombo combo gonna go down in my history book. Now I have to study for finals :(
