# Thanksgiving in New York

My sister hosed thanksgiving at her new place in NYC this year. It was the whole family + Samantha and Demcy's roomates from Singapore, Camilla (Italy) and Clemance (France). It was impressive how much she was able to cook with no planning in a tiy apartment. We went to a club called Joy Face with our parents which was pretty cool. It was a lot of music form the 70's which I liked. The next day ice skating in Bryant Park which was just lovely
