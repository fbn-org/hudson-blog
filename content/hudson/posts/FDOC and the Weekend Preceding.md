# FDOC and the Weekend Preceding

I am so glad to be back at shool. Don't get me wrong, break is great and all but it definately started getting boring towards the end. It's funny how whenever we get back from a break all the conersations we have are practically identical (or at least start the same). Something like:

"Hey how are ya doing?"\
"Great and you?"\
"Fantastic! How was your break"\
...speil...\
"and you? What'd you get up to?"\
...speil...\
...awkward silence...\
"Well see ya later"

Anyways here's my spiel:\
Ah it was pretty chill. I took two classes which took up most of my time and I also started working out. It was definitely needed but I was ready to come back by the last week.

Something like that. Anyways a few other notes of big news/life updates. Numero uno I'm doing 75 hard with Rohan. As of writing I am 30 days in and going strong. I've been waking up at 7 every day which sucks but I stared putting my phone really far away so I HAVE to get up. I am signed up for a half marathon sometime just after the challenge and my mile time is coming down like crazy which is exciting to see. Its remarkable how much more energy and focus I have from working out, eating better, and NOT DRINKING. 

Update 2:\
Everyone is abroad. Literally everyone. That's enabled me to spend a bunch of my time working out cause I don't have those pesky friendships weighing me down anymore. No but in all seriousness it sucks. On the bright side, Im getting closer with my new roomates and a couple of my Aerospace Engineering friends which is exciting. I'm trying to see the positives in all this, like I have an opportunity to branch out and hang out with people that I really enjoy spending time with, but never had the time to fully appreciate.

Wow that's a lot of suff about not the FDOC and the Weekend Preceding. Here's the actual post now:

Got here on Friday. Soeun was the only one moved in and that remained true for the whole weekend. It was a little weird at first, her being a girl and all, but we are really good friends so it was fine. Weird is the wrong word. We pinpointed how it felt for the first couple of days last night. It's like she was just coming over to hang out and then slept over for some reason. It's all fine now, especially since the other roommates moved in. In other big news, Rohan and I got invited to a party (big news because if you recall I have no friends and we are both sober for the time being). I was worried about going but swiftly upon arriving rememberd how funny drunk people are and also how good at talking to people Rohan and I are. It ended up being a blast and I met a bunch of new people. That was like Friday or Saturday or something. Rest of the weekend I just hung out and got ready for school. FDOC was great! Again waking up at 7 sucks but I felt awake and ready for my 9am class which is a first for me. My schedule is pretty light this semester, but the courses are difficult. I am very excited for them to start picking up. I think they're gonna be challenging but in a good way.

Wow that was a long one! Moral of the story, I'm excited for the semester!
