# 75 Hard (and school i guess)

Wow a lot has happened. I'm not sure if I am going to be able to cover it all here, I probrably froget a lot of things that happened. Here's how this is going to work: I'm gonna go through my photos album and comment on what was happening at the time


# 1

This was a pretty formative expienrece this semester for me. One of the semester's goals was to expand my friend circles and actually be freiends with other engineers. One of my QUEST friends, Carter, invited me to a party at his place. First solo sober party. It was pretty fun but the definate highlight of the night was these random people no one knew getting hair cuts in the bathroom.

Somehow this is the best picture I have of this. I went snowboarding. I really wrecked my knees hitting the moguls (I am not expierenced at all), and it gave me my first real "oh shit" moment. Injuries are real and if I wasnt more careful 75 hard would just be a fart in the wind.

So because all my friends left and I cant drink beer, I ended up at Caelia's place, watching the superbowl with her family (shout out Luicus). Her dad is a really good cook and and has some pretty interesting stories. Go Birds fuck KC mid commercials mid halftime show (got better after watching a youtube video on why it was not in fact a mid halftime show)

I found this sign really funny. Caution! Health Center! like what? Is it gonna hit me?

I think I would like to do standup comedy at some point. I have started writing down funny things. I really like making people laugh and I think I might be good at it

# 5
![snow day](/content/hudson/images/75Hard/IMG_6576.JPEG)

This was the first time I really felt like "thank god I didnt study abroad." One of the most college expierences of all time. At one point like 50 people werelined up on one side of the mall and 50 were lined uup on the other and we all charged at eachoter throwing snowballs. And school got cancelled the next day 10/10

The pledges are here...

# 7
![run](/content/hudson/images/75Hard/IMG_9344.PNG)

I musta taken that one on accident on a run (and not a very fast one at that) but it got me thinking. Next week I'm running a half and at the onset of this challenge I had grand dreams of being a great runner. I'm built like one and I always suspected that I could be really good at it if I trained. My first run new year's day was 12 minuite miles for 45 mins. Then, every day I ran, my goal was to go out and run faster. I made consistent progress til about halfway through the challenge when I ran 8:07 for the 45 mins. I hated it. I have since basically stopped running and have committed to struggling through this half as my debut and final race. The Goggins book is inpiring me though...

![dye](/content/hudson/images/75Hard/IMG_9349.JPEG)

This picture is from a semi successful attempt to dye my white drawstring jeans black. This sort of represents how much I have gotten into thrifting and clothes over the past few months. It's super rewarding to find something you have been looking for for a while and then you get to wear it and it becomes a part of you.

# 9
![pulley](/content/hudson/images/75Hard/IMG_9411.JPEG)

So one of my main goals with this challenge was to become a better climber. Eppley just put in an indoor wall and I try and go every other day to practice. I have seen crazy improvement but I must emphasize the importance of EVERY OTHER DAY. I went 2 days in a row and got really sharp pain in the areas above. I was worried it was a pulley (~1 month of rest) but it went away in a couple days. Another reminder to be more careful

# 10
![jazz](/content/hudson/images/75Hard/IMG_9445.JPEG)

Another goal of the semester is to attempt to develop something resembling a music taste. Part of that journey is always saying yes and having an open mind. Caelia is really into jazz and invited us all to this famous club called Blues Alley. I didnt really know what to expect but it blew me away. It was clear that the guy playing sax (kim waters) had spent his whole life mastering his craft. It was truly magical to see and helped me understand a little more about why music means so much to people. (I never really had a deep emotional connection to music in the way I see so many people have)



I dont want to write any more but a lot more happened. Tomorrow is the last day of the challenge and then I am off to Spain to go see the guys again. Did I learn a lot about myself? Yeah, maybe not from the challenge directly though. I think one of the best ways to learn more is to put yourself in different and uncomfortable situations which is exactly what this was. I am very glad to have done it and I am glad it is over. I'm no longer afraid of the gym and I have seen real physical progress for the first time in my life.
