# Life Post 75

I redownloaded instagram. I apologize for the blog content slowing down. I will try and remedy that now. For those telling me my spelling is bad, thank you for your concern. This is my blog and therefore the spelling will be as I see fit.

# 1. Spain

I went to spain with Caelia, SoEun, and Rohan to visit the guys (-Eric). I really missed them so it was super nice to be able to see them. Going clubbing and such was very fun, brought me back to my hostel days. It was nice to see everyone in that environment and just chill during the day. I felt a little guilty about flying to Spain and spending like 8 hours a day watching Invincible, but honesty, thats really what I wanted to do. Just sit around and talk and watch TV. It was like they never left. Looking forward to seeing all of you again and hearing about all the crazy shit that has happened since


# 2. Four State

I walked four state with Caelia. For those who don't know, four state is a 24 hour, 50 mile long hike that takes you through WVA, VA, MD, and PA. It's run by the Terrapin Trails Club (shoutout Minh for basically forcing me to do it). We started the hike at just around 9pm and went to 4pm (I think?) the next day. It was by far the hardest thing I have ever done. The physical pain was not even a huge issue. I mean yeah it hurt and it sucked and my feet felt like they were gonna come off and I was chafing like a MF but once you commit to finishing its relatively easy to just walk through the pain. The struggle came from summoning the will to take another step. It becomes a battle. You feel like if you blink you'll just fall asleep. I was doing so fine until the second to last leg. Thank you Caelia for keeping me motivated.


# 3. Away Weekend

I give away weekend a lot of shit cause its so far away (OBX is like 6 hours - 8 with traffic and stops) but ofc I loved it and had a great time. The drive down was honestly beautiful. We hit some empty country roads with 50mph speed limits right at sunset and rolled down the windows and blasted music. Got there at a "reasonable" time and went to the beach to look at the stars. Next day was party hard and eat good. Also it was SoEun's bday. Beautiful sunset and more laying on the beach. It's what the soul needs. The drive back was not as fun but still went by. A fantasic away weekend.

# 4. Big moves


# 5. Boeing

I got Boeing. Going to Everett WA to be an Airplane Systems Engineer intern (no idea what that means but I like the words). Crazy last minute. Incredably over the moon and incredably fortunate. Flying on a 737 is what got me into aerospace engineering and airplanes in the first place so this is pretty much a dream come true. My office is literally right next to the plant where they build the planes
