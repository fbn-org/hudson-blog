Philly Might be the Place for me

# Philly Might be the Place for me

This weekend my good friend Matty invited us to go to Philly with him and attend a very fancy dinner at the top of a very fancy building. The drive up was not bad, Eric drove the whole way. We ate way too many snacks: a family size bag of Funyuns, a whole bag of beef jerky, a box of Royal Farms chicken, AND a whole bag of Sour Punch Straws.

Driving through the city to our hotel, I was struck by the pleasant beauty of the city. Last time I was here I didn't think much of it, but now that I'm getting closer to graduating it's like I'm seeing things differently.

Tonight we're going to dinner at a very fancy restaurant, but first my fantastic friends said they want to help me make a blog. I guess we'll see how that goes.

Here's a picture of me Eric took somewhat recently to test how images work:
